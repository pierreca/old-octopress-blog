<p>I published <a href="https://github.com/pierreca/Galileo">a very simplistic 3d model of Intels Galileo (v1) board</a> on Github 2 days ago. It was built using OpenScad and the code is available as well as the exported STL file.</p>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pierreca/Galileo/master/Images/galileo_v1_3d.PNG" alt="Galileo 3D model image"></p>

<p>I rely on 3D models a lot during the design of any project because its a way for me to cut on prototyping costs and times. One thing that often leaves me wanting more with a lot of projects I see from makers is the fact that it stays on a breadboard. Theres rarely any PCB design, and even more rarely enclosure or industrial design that would make the thing sturdy and reliable enough to function on something else than a desk I guess Ill write about that and maybe some techniques that I have found useful later</p>

<p>Please try this design with various enclosures, use it, and let me know if it works well or if somethings off!</p>
