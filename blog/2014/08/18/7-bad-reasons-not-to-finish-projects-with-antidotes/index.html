<div class="entry-content"><p>Years of tinkering with electronics and building apps on week-ends and evenings, and recently I have found myself thinking that I never really finish anything. It has been bugging me to a point where I felt really bad about it&hellip; The weird thing is, it&rsquo;s not at all the same at work. I&rsquo;m focused and I always have a clear idea of what&rsquo;s done, what&rsquo;s expected and I know when and how to deliver things on time and meeting my team QA standards.<br/>
I also realized I know of a lot of people feeling the same with their own projects, so let&rsquo;s share: here&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s going on in my maker head, and how I &ldquo;snap out of it&rdquo; and get things done, slowly, but surely. Maybe you&rsquo;ll recognize some of the symptoms, hopefully you&rsquo;ll find something useful here.</p>

<h3>1. The 99 projects syndrome</h3>

<p>If only I had one single project. I have 99 projects and every night as I go to sleep I think about yet another one, that I will probably start soon because I&rsquo;m so thrilled by that brilliant new idea&hellip; and I&rsquo;ll leave the rest for later. I simply start more projects than I can finish.</p>

<p><em>I now give myself a one week &ldquo;cool down period&rdquo; not only to think about the project but also to understand if I really want do it fully, or if it&rsquo;s just a fad. Just in case, I add it to <a href="http://pierreca.github.io/projects">my bucket list</a> and when I finish something I look into this list to decide what&rsquo;s next.</em></p>

<h3>2. &ldquo;I already know how to finish this&rdquo;</h3>

<p>That project was fun because it was an enigma to solve, a mind game. Now that I know how to solve it, it has lost its interest. Compared to a new project, it feels like I&rsquo;ll learn less just finishing the first one.</p>

<p><em>That&rsquo;s lack of experience speaking. The more I grow, the less I feel this, because I know that until something&rsquo;s shipped, no-one knows what problems will happen during &ldquo;real-life&rdquo; implementation.</em></p>

<h3>3. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s someone else&rsquo;s fault if I&rsquo;m blocked&rdquo;</h3>

<p>I had found this really cool way of solving a particular issue, using that open-source project. Unfortunately it has bugs, that prevent me from moving forward. Their fault, not mine, me thinks.</p>

<p><em>Little voice in my head: It&rsquo;s open-source, moron. fix it yourself! 9 times out of 10 it&rsquo;s easier than I think.</em></p>

<h3>4. &ldquo;It takes too much time!&rdquo;</h3>

<p>So&hellip; I thought it was going to be easy, and it turns out it&rsquo;s not. That particular component is going to take me days to finish, I&rsquo;m not seeing the end of it. The sheer amount of work left scares me.</p>

<p><em>OK, it&rsquo;s bad planning. Why did I think otherwise at the beginning? What did I learn since then? Feeling good about this maker-life lesson, then committing to not making this mistake again gives me motivation to push forward.</em></p>

<h3>5. &ldquo;I bought that thing but I have no idea what to do with it&rdquo;</h3>

<p>Shiny new toy, ordered too fast&hellip; I even bought the accessories and paid for the 2-day delivery option! When it was delivered I feverishly unboxed it. Then followed the &ldquo;getting started&rdquo; instructions. Then what? errr&hellip; I&rsquo;m not sure. I could use it to restart this other project but it would likely take longer than finish it with the old kit. OK, I&rsquo;m just going to put that new toy on a shelf for when I need it.</p>

<p><em>I now add it to the bucket list instead of buying it. Then I think about what I could finish quickly to free some time and buy that shiny new toy.</em></p>

<h3>6. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a working prototype but it&rsquo;s ugly and I don&rsquo;t know how to make it pretty&rdquo;</h3>

<p>It&rsquo;s working! it&rsquo;s alive! but I don&rsquo;t want to call it done because it&rsquo;s ugly. It&rsquo;s still on a breadboard, I need to find a way to do the enclosure too. Or maybe I spent hours designing an enclosure and $$ laser cutting it just to end up with an ugly impractical thing. Now I&rsquo;m depressed and I don&rsquo;t have the energy to move to v2. And I don&rsquo;t want to show it like that.</p>

<p><em>Whatever I&rsquo;ll show it anyway. Here&rsquo;s my ugly <a href="http://github.com/pierreca/LightClock">LightClock</a>. It&rsquo;s not pretty but it&rsquo;s v1, it&rsquo;s better than nothing at all. v2 is coming anyway :)</em></p>

<h3>7. &ldquo;I keep adding features, it&rsquo;s never stable!&rdquo;</h3>

<p>Basics are done :) This project does stuff, but as it grows I keep adding features, so it&rsquo;s actually never in a shippable state and now that I have started these new features I need to finish them.</p>

<p><em>Again, lack of experience, I find myself making that mistake less and less. Working with github and feature branches as if I were part of a team help me separate must-have items from nice-to-have. Adopting the MVP mindset from the startup culture helps a lot. Ship early, ship often, even if you&rsquo;re your only user.</em></p>

<h2>7 additional tips that help me (hint: combine them!)</h2>

<h3>1. Build some social pressure</h3>

<p>Get one or more real users excited about it: friends, family, colleagues, followers&hellip; Tell them about what you&rsquo;d like to build, it will likely help you find out if it&rsquo;s really interesting, and then keep them posted about it! As soon as you can, add it to your github account, or publish it on <a href="http://www.hackster.io">hackster.io</a> or <a href="http://www.hackaday.io">hackaday.io</a>.</p>

<h3>2. Start small</h3>

<p>An optimal solution to a problem is a combination of optimal solutions for subproblems. That&rsquo;s one thing of an old dynamic programming course that stuck. Split your project in subproblems, and start solving one of them. Then ship it and move to the next one. Split it into as many smaller problems as you can. And ship every subproblem solution.</p>

<h3>3. Don&rsquo;t start something new until you shipped the previous thing</h3>

<p>Sure that new idea&rsquo;s cool, but you ought to finish the one you&rsquo;re working on first. The motivation for the next project will help you finish the current one. Just make sure your idea doesn&rsquo;t go to waste, write it somewhere. That&rsquo;s why I created <a href="http://pierreca.github.io/projects/">this page</a>.</p>

<h3>4. Find a coach/mentor/instructor/teacher</h3>

<p>That project may not be a team project, but it doesn&rsquo;t mean you can&rsquo;t get help from others. Especially someone with more experience. I bet not many private pilot students would get to the checkride if it wasn&rsquo;t for that spark of motivation that a good instructor can give you when you botch a shortfield landing for the tenth time. More often that not people will be honored to be asked to mentor a project, even a silly one :)</p>

<h3>5. Set a deadline</h3>

<p>It&rsquo;s certainly the easiest/dumbest advice of the list, &lsquo;cause really, everybody knows that setting deadlines help&hellip; Surprisingly though, not many people do it for personal projects. Combined with social pressure, it&rsquo;s a huge motivation nonetheless. Think about how you would like to reveal your project to others: find the perfect time for that, and go for it. Getting that Private Pilot License before I go back to see the friend who offered me my first ride in a small airplane sure was important.</p>

<h3>6. Maintain bucket lists</h3>

<p>Lists are easy to keep updated. They are great to remind you not only what you have coming next, but also what you have achieved already. That <a href="http://pierreca.github.io/projects/">projects page</a> is a portfolio, an agenda, and a tool to help me apply tips #1, #3 and #5.</p>

<h3>7. Always remember why you&rsquo;re doing it</h3>

<p>What&rsquo;s the motivation? Why am I doing this? &ldquo;Because it&rsquo;s fun&rdquo; is not an acceptable answer anymore, there is always a deeper motive anyway: before I set on doing something, I commit to finding the real purpose for that project first.</p>

<p>So what&rsquo;s going to work best for you?</p>
